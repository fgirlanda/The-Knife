The updated decor gives the restaurant even more appeal, as does the culinary style and philosophy showcased on three tasting menus: “Io e Silva”, which includes decidedly imaginative dishes (such as cooked and raw shellfish with a dash of soya and peppers) and is dedicated to his wife; “Io e Giorgio”, dedicated to his mentor and former restaurant owner, which features more classic recipes; and, last but not least, the completely vegetarian “L'Essenza”. Special mention must be made of the wine list, which includes an extensive selection of French labels, of which both the sommelier and Giancarlo are huge fans. As a final attraction, make sure you find time to visit the Roman ruins in the basement. We also highly recommend booking the chef's table where you can dine as a couple yet at the same time enjoy the company of the skilled chefs whom you’ll observe working together like the well-practised members of an orchestra – an extraordinary sight!","45.4426941","10.9961161"

The cuisine is presented on three tasting menus (Classico, Max and Raf), with the option of reducing the number of courses and choosing dishes from different menus, almost à la carte style. With its combination of familiar flavours and imaginative twists, Max’s cuisine celebrates the restaurant’s signature dishes such as the “passi d’oro” 2.0 risotto and the famous cuttlefish cappuccino in black ink, as well as creative dishes inspired by the passing seasons. The restaurant also has its own delicatessen for anyone keen to purchase a gourmet souvenir.","45.4215425","11.8096633"

Hidden among the private beach clubs that crowd Senigallia’s seafront, this three-Michelin-star restaurant comes as a surprise, surrounded as it is by beach parasols and the sound of the sea lapping on the shore. The strength and originality of Uliassi’s cuisine lies in his ability to make good use of local ingredients, taking inspiration from the culinary traditions that have been so familiar and successful along this coastline over the past few decades and giving them a personal, creative twist. Fish and seafood obviously take pride of place, although there’s also room on the menu for meat, inspired by the Marche’s traditional game dishes – the delicious skewered pigeon is cooked to perfection! The colourful dining experience here is enhanced by the owner’s warm welcome, with Mauro’s sister Catia and his son Filippo working alongside the chef. It’s also worth mentioning that the restaurant has a keen focus on the environment, hence its banning of the use of plastic and doing its utmost to persuade its fish suppliers not to use polystyrene to transport their fish.","43.7194609","13.2206503"

It’s worth coming here simply to experience the service, an impeccable waltz directed by Alessandro Tomberli, one of the best maître-d’s in Italy. Annie Féolde, one of the restaurant’s icons, left the reins to the highly talented chef Riccardo Monco, who continues to nurture and satisfy the Italian appetite for fine cuisine.

Although this chef originally from Vico Equense in Campania takes inspiration from all over Italy and further afield, it is the passion, colour and intense flavours of his native region that shine through in all his dishes. The two tasting menus, as well as the concise à la carte, showcase elegant dishes full of goodness where the focus is on fish and seafood (although meat also features).

From this, he decided to branch out and open a pizzeria “four steps from the sea” (hence the name Quattro Passi), which over the years his son Antonio and now his grandson Fabrizio have transformed into a temple to Mediterranean cuisine. Flavours, strong technique and quality ingredients combine to create an exciting feast for the tastebuds which finishes with a selection of small chocolate eggs with unusual flavours such as roquefort, rocket, chilli pepper and lemon. A host of different influences (the sea, the Sannio region, France, Japan) and ingredients (San Marzano tomatoes, Amalfi lemons) come together in Fabrizio’s cuisine, resulting in dishes that are simple, delicious and full of flavour.

Below Monte Mario hill, the whole of Rome, encircled by hills, is spread out before you, appearing silent and enchanted, almost as if it were dozing. Although he’s been at the helm here since 1994, Heinz Beck’s enthusiasm remains undiminished, as he continues to update his dishes, explore new avenues and create imaginative cuisine with a strong Italian and Mediterranean flavour.

He focuses on ingredients and recipes from his native Abruzzo, paying particular attention to vegetables and creating dishes that are striking for their intense flavours.

The menu has a broad reach, including specialities from Modena and Emilia (ingredients such as Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar and tagliatelle and tortellini pasta), as well as classic international dishes, which the chef reinterprets with a light and playful touch, reminding us that food should not be a boring ritual but instead an enjoyable experience influenced by memory and culture.

One of the menus is inspired by the vegetable gardens and the seasons, another by the region, while the third takes guests on a culinary journey through Italy and further afield. What is obvious in every single, delicious bite is the chef’s passion for plants, with vegetables, flowers, wild and cultivated herbs harvested daily all featuring in memorable, beautifully presented dishes. The iconic appetisers featuring countless delicious ingredients are a feast for the eyes and the tastebuds alike and were particularly enjoyed by our inspectors. It hardly needs mentioning that this region is passionate about wine, so it’s not entirely surprising that the restaurant offers three different wine lists: Solopiemonte pays superb homage to the region, while Tuttoilresto (divided into two options, white and red) is a celebration of French wines. The efficient and enthusiastic serving staff succeed in taking good care of guests without being excessively formal, so that three hours (roughly the amount of time you need to allow for your meal) pass almost without noticing.

The top-quality ingredients are sourced from a local kitchen garden, as well as from a small family farm in Federica’s native Calabria.

There are just 20 seats in this warm, intimate and unfussy restaurant, as well as a large counter separated by an arch at the entrance which precedes the recently restructured kitchen. Observation of his own region has shown owner-chef Luca Fracassi that the varied geography of his province is an inexhaustible source of inspiration.

His cuisine is modern yet eschews modern trends, paying careful attention to integrity of flavour and zero waste. In this way, the kitchen becomes a place in which wild ingredients and forgotten flavours are rediscovered and brought back to life. This focus on lost traditions combines ingredients such as snails and game (often neglected in urban restaurants) with a skilful and updated use of contemporary culinary techniques.","43.4645907","11.8796939"
